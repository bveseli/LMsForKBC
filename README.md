# LMsForKBC: Evaluating Language Models for Knowledge Base Completion

In our paper *Evaluating Language Models for Knowledge Base Completion* we analyze the feasibility of Knowledge Base Completion by using Language Models. 
As a language model we use BERT and as a knowledge base we use Wikidata. We publish a new benchmark dataset *WD-KNOWN* along with the human evaluation of predictions for *really* missing facts, i.e. (subject,relation)-pairs non-existent in Wikidata. 
 

## Dataset
Please find the WD_known dataset and the *unknown facts*, i.e. facts that are not present in WikiData, in the data folder.
